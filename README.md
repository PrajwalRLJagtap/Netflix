Netflix started in 1997 as a rent-by-mail DVD service that used a pay-per-rental model. Users would browse and order the films they wanted on their website, put in an order, and Netflix would post them to your door. After renters had finished with the DVDs, they would simply post them back. On July 10, 2020, Netflix became the largest entertainment company by market capitalization.
